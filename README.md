## 🌟 Why I Built This
I created **QuoteAPI** to **strengthen my technical skills in API development**, backend programming, and **handling structured data**.  
This project helps me understand **how web services interact with applications**, a crucial skill for building scalable and efficient software.

As someone passionate about **learning new technologies**, this project allowed me to gain **hands-on experience with Flask** and HTTP request handling while reinforcing my ability to **write clean, efficient, and reusable code**.  

Developing QuoteAPI is also part of my **commitment to improving my technical grit**, as seen through my coursework in **Python, Java, HTML, C, and Stata programming**, and my recent focus on **building APIs and backend systems**.

## 🚀 Next Steps
🔹 **Add more quote categories** (e.g., "Tech Quotes," "Leadership Quotes")  
🔹 **Deploy on Render or Railway** for public access  
🔹 **Implement search functionality** to filter quotes by author  
🔹 **Build a simple frontend UI** to display the quotes visually  
🔹 **Expand into a larger microservice that integrates external APIs**
