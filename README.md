ðŸŒŸ Why I Built This
I created QuoteAPI to strengthen my technical skills in API development, backend programming, and handling structured data.
This project helps me understand how web services interact with applications, a crucial skill for building scalable and efficient software.

Next Steps
ðŸ”¹ Add more quote categories (e.g., "Tech Quotes," "Leadership Quotes")
ðŸ”¹ Deploy on Render or Railway for public access
ðŸ”¹ Build a simple frontend UI to display the quotes visually
